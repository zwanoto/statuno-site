We calmly worked out the statistics together using the screen-sharing function. Despite not being a natural at statistics, I was able to understand and present them at my defense without any problems. Thomas, a friendly and highly competent statistician, offers an ideal solution, especially when time is short, through his short-term online booking system. For me, Thomas was a godsend!</p>

<div class="review">
    <p class="comment" style="line-height: 120%;color:black;">As a student, it's really challenging to find a proficient math tutor, especially one with a background in finance (business administration & business psychology). I was preparing for my second attempt at the math module, having previously failed with a disappointing score of 5.0, so I sought Thomas's assistance. Thomas quickly tailored his approach to meet my needs and expectations for our study sessions, allowing me control over the preparation, while closely supporting me. He's a consummate professional, able to not only understand all the tasks quickly but also explain them in a very understandable manner. Thomas consistently encouraged me (essential when feeling uncertain!) and was very flexible time-wise. Our study sessions were conducted via web conference and went flawlessly. It was particularly helpful that Thomas would email me the reviewed tasks after each session. If you're seeking assistance in mathematics or statistics and value skilled and pleasant tutoring, Thomas is the one for you. I was able to improve my score from 5.0 to 1.3, which far exceeded my expectations! Every euro spent on Thomas's tutoring was worth it - thank you very much! - Julian</p>

      Customer reviews are only published with their full names if the customer has explicitly given their consent for publication. Customer reviews that we receive directly always undergo an authenticity check. If customer reviews are sourced from external sites, the customer's names will be shortened for data privacy reasons, while the content of the review remains unchanged in all instances. Moreover, to ensure objectivity, it's guaranteed that all customer reviews from these external sites are published, provided they have been approved for publication.
